Introduction

This is a responsive To-Do List UI built using Angular and Tailwind CSS. I created this project in July 2025 as part of a job application assessment. Although I had never built a to-do app before, I wanted to challenge myself to learn Angular and Tailwind quicklyâ€”and I completed the project within two days. It demonstrates my ability to learn fast, build responsive UIs, and apply modern front-end tools effectively.

- Tailwind CSS
